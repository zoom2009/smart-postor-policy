      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, Privacy Policy collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Privacy Policy's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Privacy Policy's visitors use its website. From time to time, Privacy Policy may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>Privacy Policy also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://smart-postor.netlify.app blog posts. Privacy Policy only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to Privacy Policy's websites choose to interact with Privacy Policy in ways that require Privacy Policy to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Privacy Policy gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://smart-postor.netlify.app to provide a username and email address.</p>
